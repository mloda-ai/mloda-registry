# Options

How to pass configuration to features and feature groups.

**What**: Configuration container with group/context separation.
**When**: Passing parameters to features (data sources, algorithms, thresholds).
**Why**: Group options affect feature group resolution; context options are metadata only.
**Where**: Feature creation, `input_features()`, `calculate_feature()`.

## Group vs Context

| Category | Purpose | Affects Hashing |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| `group` | Parameters affecting resolution/splitting | Yes |
| `context` | Metadata that doesn't affect splitting | No |

**Group** options determine how features are batched and which FeatureGroup handles them. Two features with identical group options are considered equal and processed together. Use group for parameters that change the output: algorithm choice, data source, model version.

**Context** options carry metadata that doesn't affect grouping. Features with different context but same group are still batched together. Use context for input feature references (`in_features`), debug flags, logging levels, or runtime hints.

**Default**: When you pass a dict without specifying `group=` or `context=`, it goes to **group**. This means `Options({"algo": "kmeans"})` is equivalent to `Options(group={"algo": "kmeans"})`. Be explicit when you need context-only parameters.

## Example

```python
from mloda.user import Feature, Options

# Configuration-based feature creation
feature = Feature("imputed_income", Options(
    group={"algorithm": "mean"},
    context={"in_features": "income"}
))
```
