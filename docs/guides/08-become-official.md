# Become an Official Plugin

A plugin becomes "official" when your PR is merged into the mloda-registry repository.

## Requirements

1. Follow the [contribution guide](07-contribute-to-official.md)
2. Pass CI checks (tests, linting, builds)
3. Get PR approved and merged

## That's It

Once merged, your plugin is official and available to all mloda users.
